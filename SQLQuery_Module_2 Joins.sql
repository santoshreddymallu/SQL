-- Joins
	-- Joins play a crucial role in RDBMS - Relational Data
	-- There are 3 types of Joins
		-- Inner Join
		-- Outer Join (Left Outer Join/Left Join, Right Outer Join/Right Join, Full Outer Join/Full Join)
		-- Cross Join

-- Create a table that holds DOB for each employee

	-- Cross join is the cartesian product of both the tables
	-- Each record from one table is joined with all the records from the other table
